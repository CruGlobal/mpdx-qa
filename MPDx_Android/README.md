Project setup 2019-05-06
1. Unzip MPDx_Android
2. In IntelliJ Import project from external model, using Maven (highlighting Maven).  Press Next
3. On the next screen, set JDK for importer to version 11.  Use other defaults
4. Select Mavin projects to import (checked MPDx:MPDx:1.0-SNAPSHOT).  Next
5. Project SDK 11 was selected.  Accepted as is.
6. project name - accepted default.
7. The developer noticed that I had two modules - MPDx and main (which I had probably created unawares).  He disconnected main so that MPDx would be the only module.
8. He had me create under src the directory structure test/java/com.mpdx
	and mark it as Test Sources Root.  And moved  Android_MPDx_Test file into com.mpdx directory.
	
I updated the KOBITON_CREDENTIAL in Config.java and I was able to run the project

Notice in the project folder the three Test Results.

Also, I used to be able to target a specific App using kobiton-store:xxxxx.  Now you are using a URL based on amazonaws.
How do I work with this using the test project with different app versions?
